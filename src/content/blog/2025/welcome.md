Welcome to my blog. This is where I will post articles about projects that I'm working on or other things that I'm exploring.

This blog, and in fact the the website as a whole, was motivated by the launch of [my Pokemon AI project](src/images/projects/2025/pokemon-ai.jpg). I made [a Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudePlaysPokemon/comments/1msurbo/) about the project and had my account swiftly banned by an automated spam filter for being new (despite the fact that the post had a 100% upvote ratio and was completely on topic...). This was a frustrating experience and it killed a lot of the momentum behind the project. I'm not the kind of person who posts much on the internet, but I learned the hard way that if I want to get my work out into the world, I have to engage more consistently with the community instead of just dropping a link when things are done

This blog, and some of the other accounts I've made with it, are my attempt to do that.
